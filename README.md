## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned that Bootstrap isn't for everything and to stop relying on it for projects it has no business being on. It's a crutch. I also learned how to better debug issues using the dev tools built into my browser. Lastly, I got a lesson in semantics and writing accessible code which is important to me.

### Continued development

I'd really like to practice more with layering and positioning elements as well as how to best utilize SVGs. This was the first time I've attempted to do both and I struggled. I've been relying too much on Bootstrap and not enough on practicing my CSS flex skills.



### Useful resources

- [Semantics] https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/188612/semantic-markup-for-card-blocks) - This helped me better grasp how to write accessible HTML
- [Example resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Styling_lists) - This helped me get a better idea of what else I can use in my HTML so I don't rely so much on div, h1-h6, span.
